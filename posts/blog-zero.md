# Blog #0

## Why I have created this blog site:
 **Initially, I noticed that most passionate developers have their kind of a platform/space to share their ideas about a certain  technology or even just give general opinions about software and I consider myself a passionate dev as well then, I thought well I have nothing to talk about because seriously I don't have a ton of epxerience and giudance to provide to others and generally I am not a big talker, but eventaully after some contemplating i figured that having a blog is not about being super experienced or being the most skilled developer but by actually doing this I can gain some deeper understanding of a technology or a language within the process of talking about what I think I understand and also share it with others.** 


# The plan: 
 - **Posting here at least once every month about anything I want to talk about**
 - **Talk about technologies that I am using and the new ones that I learn on the way as technincally as I can**
